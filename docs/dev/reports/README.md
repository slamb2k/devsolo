## Lifecycle

Reports are historical records:
- Keep them for future reference
- They document decisions and learnings
- Extract reusable patterns → move to [../learnings/](../learnings/)
- If no longer relevant → move to [../../archive/](../../archive/)

## Related Documentation

- See [../plans/](../plans/) for implementation plans that led to these reports
- See [../learnings/](../learnings/) for extracted best practices
