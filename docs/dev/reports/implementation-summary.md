# DevSolo Simplified Workflow Implementation Summary

## Completed Work

### Phase 1: Pre-Flight/Post-Flight Check Infrastructure ✅
Created comprehensive validation framework:

**Files Created:**
- `src/services/validation/pre-flight-checks.ts` - Base classes for pre/post-flight checks
- `src/services/validation/branch-validator.ts` - Branch lifecycle and reuse validation
- `src/services/validation/pr-validator.ts` - PR conflict detection and validation

**Features:**
- Extensible check framework with pass/fail/warning levels
- Automatic suggestion generation for failures
- Visual output formatting (✓/⚠/✗)
- Check count summaries

### Phase 2: Branch Reuse Prevention ✅
Implemented defensive checks to prevent branch reuse after merge:

**Scenarios Detected:**
1. **Merged & Deleted** - Branch was properly completed, BLOCKS reuse
2. **Merged & Recreated** - Branch deleted then recreated, BLOCKS reuse (CRITICAL)
3. **Continued Work** - Adding commits after merge, ALLOWS with warning
4. **Aborted** - Never merged, ALLOWS reuse

**Tracking:**
- Branch deletion timestamps in session metadata
- Merge state tracking
- Historical session analysis

### Phase 3: Simplified Ship Command ✅
Created `ShipCommandV2` that does everything automatically:

**New Behavior:**
```bash
/devsolo:ship  # Single command does:
# 1. Commit changes
# 2. Push to remote
# 3. Create/update PR
# 4. Wait for CI checks
# 5. Auto-merge
# 6. Sync main
# 7. Delete branches
# 8. Complete session
```

**Removed Flags:**
- ❌ `--push`
- ❌ `--create-pr`
- ❌ `--merge`

**Kept Flags:**
- ✅ `--yes` (skip confirmations)
- ✅ `--force` (override safety checks)
- ✅ `--message` (custom commit message)

### Phase 4: PR Conflict Detection ✅
Comprehensive PR validation:

**Detects:**
- Multiple open PRs for same branch (BLOCKS)
- Existing open PR (UPDATES instead of creating)
- Previous merged PR (CREATES NEW)
- No PR exists (CREATES)

**Enforces:**
- Single PR per feature branch lifecycle
- No duplicate PRs
- Clean PR state transitions

### Phase 5: Enhanced Launch Command ✅
Created `LaunchCommandV2` with comprehensive checks:

**Pre-Flight Checks:**
- On main/master branch
- Working directory clean
- Main up to date with origin
- No existing session
- Branch name available (checks history!)

**Post-Flight Verifications:**
- Session created
- Branch created and checked out
- Correct session state
- No uncommitted changes

## Next Steps

### 1. Replace Old Commands (Breaking Change - v2.0.0)
Once ready for release:
- Backup `src/commands/devsolo-ship.ts` → `devsolo-ship-v1.ts.bak`
- Rename `devsolo-ship-v2.ts` → `devsolo-ship.ts`
- Backup `src/commands/devsolo-launch.ts` → `devsolo-launch-v1.ts.bak`
- Rename `devsolo-launch-v2.ts` → `devsolo-launch.ts`
- Update imports in `src/index.ts` and other command files

### 2. Update MCP Server
Update `src/mcp/devsolo-mcp-server.ts`:
```typescript
{
  name: 'devsolo_ship',
  description: 'Complete workflow automatically (commit, push, PR, merge, cleanup)',
  inputSchema: {
    type: 'object',
    properties: {
      message: { type: 'string', description: 'Commit message' },
      yes: { type: 'boolean', description: 'Skip confirmations' },
      force: { type: 'boolean', description: 'Force operations' },
      // REMOVED: push, createPR, merge flags
    },
  },
}
```

### 3. Write Tests for V2 Commands
Create comprehensive tests:
- `tests/services/validation/branch-validator.test.ts`
- `tests/services/validation/pr-validator.test.ts`
- `tests/services/validation/pre-flight-checks.test.ts`
- `tests/commands/devsolo-ship-v2.test.ts`
- `tests/commands/devsolo-launch-v2.test.ts`

### 4. Update Documentation

**README.md:**
```markdown
## Simplified Workflow

### Start Feature
/devsolo:launch "add-user-auth"

### Ship Feature (One Command!)
/devsolo:ship
# Automatically:
# - Commits changes
# - Pushes to remote
# - Creates PR
# - Waits for CI checks
# - Merges PR
# - Syncs main
# - Deletes branches
# - Completes session
```

**docs/PRE-FLIGHT-CHECKS.md** (NEW):
Document all pre-flight and post-flight checks for each command

**docs/MIGRATION-V2.md** (NEW):
Migration guide from v1 → v2 for users relying on old flags

🔍 Pre-Flight Checks (4/5 passed)
  ✓ On main/master branch: main
  ✓ Working directory clean
  ✓ Main up to date with origin
  ✓ No existing session
  ✗ Branch name available: Previously used for PR #15

    Suggestion: feature/add-user-auth-v2
    Suggestion: feature/add-user-auth-2024-10-03
    Suggestion: feature/add-user-auth-continued

❌ Pre-flight checks failed - aborting launch
```

## Testing Plan

### Unit Tests:
1. Branch validation logic
2. PR conflict detection
3. Pre-flight check framework
4. Post-flight verification framework

### Integration Tests:
1. Full launch → ship cycle
2. Branch reuse prevention
3. PR update vs create logic
4. Multiple session handling

### End-to-End Tests:
1. Complete workflow from launch to cleanup
2. Error recovery scenarios
3. Manual intervention cases
4. State synchronization

## Breaking Changes (v2.0.0)

### Removed:
- `--push` flag from ship command
- `--create-pr` flag from ship command
- `--merge` flag from ship command

### Changed:
- Ship command now runs complete workflow automatically
- No need to run ship multiple times
- State machine simplified (internal only)

### Migration:
**Before (v1):**
```bash
/devsolo:ship            # Commit
/devsolo:ship --push     # Push
/devsolo:ship --create-pr # Create PR
/devsolo:ship --merge    # Merge
```

**After (v2):**
```bash
/devsolo:ship  # Does everything
```

## Defensive Guarantees

### Enforced Invariants:
1. ✅ Only one active session per branch
2. ✅ Only one PR per feature branch lifecycle
3. ✅ No branch reuse after merge + deletion
4. ✅ Main branch always synced after merge
5. ✅ Complete cleanup after successful merge
6. ✅ All checks visible to user
7. ✅ Clear failure messages with suggestions

### What Users Can Trust:
- Pre-flight checks catch issues before execution
- Post-flight verifications confirm success
- Branch lifecycle strictly enforced
- PR state always consistent
- No silent failures
- Clear audit trail
