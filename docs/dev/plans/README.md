# Implementation Plans

This folder contains implementation plans, task lists, and roadmaps for upcoming features and improvements.

## Contents

- **codebase-cleanup-phase1-plan.md** - Phase 1 (Quick Wins) implementation plan for codebase optimization: removing build artifacts, unused dependencies, and runtime files

## What Goes Here

- Feature implementation plans
- Task breakdowns for complex changes
- Roadmaps and milestones
- Sprint/iteration plans
- Architecture change proposals

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names with dates:
- `feature-name-implementation-plan.md`
- `YYYY-MM-DD-task-list.md`
- `refactor-component-plan.md`

## Lifecycle

When a plan is completed:
1. Add completion status to the document
2. Keep it here for reference (shows what was planned vs executed)
3. Create a summary in [../reports/](../reports/) if significant learnings emerged
4. If superseded by a new approach, move to [../../archive/](../../archive/)

## Related Documentation

- See [../reports/](../reports/) for summaries after plan execution
- See [../learnings/](../learnings/) for patterns discovered during implementation
