# Development Learnings

This folder contains reusable patterns, coding strategies, testing approaches, naming conventions, and best practices discovered during han-solo development.

## Purpose

This serves as institutional memory - a knowledge base for current and future developers to:
- Avoid repeating mistakes
- Reuse successful patterns
- Understand why certain approaches were chosen
- Maintain consistency across the codebase

## What Goes Here

- Coding patterns and idioms
- Testing strategies and fixtures
- Naming conventions
- Architecture patterns
- Performance optimization techniques
- Error handling approaches
- State management patterns
- Git workflow learnings
- Tool configurations and why

## Structure Suggestions

Organize by topic:
- `typescript-patterns.md` - TypeScript-specific patterns
- `testing-strategies.md` - Testing approaches that work well
- `state-machine-patterns.md` - State management learnings
- `git-workflow-best-practices.md` - Git/GitHub workflow insights
- `mcp-integration-patterns.md` - MCP server patterns
- `error-handling.md` - Error handling approaches

## How to Use

When implementing new features:
1. Check this folder for relevant patterns
2. Apply proven approaches
3. Add new learnings when you discover something valuable

When you discover a pattern worth preserving:
1. Extract it from the implementation
2. Document why it works
3. Provide examples
4. Add it here for others to find
