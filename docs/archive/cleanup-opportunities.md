# Cleanup Opportunities - COMPLETED ✅

This document tracked cleanup tasks identified after the v2 architecture simplification.

**Status: All cleanup tasks have been completed!**

## Summary of Completed Work

### ✅ 1. Eliminated Adapter Layer
**Completed:** All 7 commands now implement `CommandHandler` directly
- Migrated: InitCommand, LaunchCommand, ShipCommand, HotfixCommand, SessionsCommand, SwapCommand, AbortCommand
- Deleted: `command-adapters.ts` (~163 lines)
- Updated: `command-registry.ts` to instantiate commands directly
- **Impact:** Removed ~200 lines of code, simpler architecture, one less layer of indirection

### ✅ 2. Updated API Documentation
**Completed:** Removed outdated API references
- Removed `abortAll()` method from AbortCommand docs (now CLI-only via `--all` flag)
- Removed `resume()` method from LaunchCommand docs (replaced by swap command)
- Removed `session_resumed` from AuditAction type
- Cleaned up `docs/design/devsolo-prd.md` - removed `auto_resume` and `resume_on_merge` config options
- Cleaned up `docs/BANNER_CONSOLIDATION.md` - removed resume investigation sections

### ✅ 3. Cleaned Up Stale Documentation
**Completed:** Removed historical migration docs
- Deleted `docs/MIGRATION-V2.md` (v2 is now the current version)
- Note: Other files mentioned in original doc (ADAPTER-LAYER-IMPLEMENTATION.md, V2_IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md, etc.) did not exist

## Architecture After Cleanup

All commands now follow a consistent pattern:
```typescript
export class CommandName implements CommandHandler {
  name = 'devsolo:commandname';
  description = 'Command description';

  async execute(args: string[]): Promise<void> {
    // Parse args
    // Execute command logic
  }

  validate(args: string[]): boolean {
    return true;
  }
}
```

## Next Steps

No further cleanup needed from this document. Future improvements can be tracked in separate issues.
