# v1.x CLI Documentation Archive

This directory contains documentation from devsolo v1.x when it had a CLI interface.

## What Happened

In v2.0.0, devsolo underwent a complete architectural pivot:
- **Before (v1.x)**: Dual CLI/MCP architecture
- **After (v2.0.0)**: Pure MCP-only architecture

The CLI interface was completely removed to focus on AI-native workflows via Claude Code.

## Archived Files

### User Guides

## Migration

## Why Keep These?

These docs are preserved for:
1. Historical reference
2. v1.x users who haven't migrated
3. Understanding the architecture evolution
4. Comparison with v2.0.0 pure MCP approach
