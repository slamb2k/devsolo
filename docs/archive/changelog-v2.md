# Changelog - Version 2.0.0

## 🎉 Major Release: Complete Workflow Automation

**Release Date:** 2025-10-03

This release completely reimagines the devsolo workflow with a focus on automation, safety, and user experience.

---

## 🚀 Highlights

### One-Command Workflow
Ship your entire feature in a single command! No more running ship multiple times with different flags.

**Before:**
```bash
devsolo ship
devsolo ship --push
devsolo ship --create-pr
devsolo ship --merge
```

**Now:**
```bash
devsolo ship  # Does everything!
```

### Comprehensive Pre/Post-Flight Checks
Every command validates conditions before execution and verifies expected state after completion.

### Branch Reuse Prevention
Blocks dangerous branch name reuse scenarios that could corrupt workflow state.

### PR Conflict Detection
Enforces single PR per feature branch lifecycle with automatic update/create logic.

### Professional ASCII Art Banners
Consistent visual branding across all commands for better UX.

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. Pre-Flight Check Framework
All commands now run validation checks before executing:

- **Visual Output**: ✓/⚠/✗ indicators for each check
- **Pass/Fail Tracking**: Summary with error/warning counts
- **Actionable Suggestions**: Failed checks include fix recommendations
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new checks per command

**Commands with pre-flight checks:**
- ✅ Launch
- ✅ Ship
- ✅ Cleanup
- ✅ Abort
- ✅ Swap
- ✅ Status
- ✅ Sessions

### 2. Post-Flight Verification Framework
Commands verify expected state after execution:

- **State Confirmation**: Verifies session state, branch location, etc.
- **Cleanup Verification**: Confirms branches deleted, main synced
- **Failure Detection**: Catches issues that slip through execution

### 3. Branch Validation Service
New validation service prevents branch reuse issues:

**Features:**
- Tracks branch history in session metadata
- Detects merged-and-deleted scenarios
- Detects merged-and-recreated scenarios (critical)
- Generates alternative branch name suggestions

**Scenarios Handled:**
| Scenario | Action | Reason |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Merged & Deleted | BLOCK | Name retired |
| Merged & Recreated | BLOCK | Critical - improper reuse |
| Continued Work | ALLOW | New PR for additional changes |
| Aborted | ALLOW | Never merged, safe to reuse |

### 4. PR Validation Service
Enforces single PR per branch lifecycle:

**Features:**
- Detects multiple open PRs (blocks)
- Updates existing PR instead of creating duplicate
- Creates new PR after previous one merged
- Prevents PR state conflicts

**Logic:**
```
Multiple open PRs → BLOCK (manual intervention)
Single open PR → UPDATE (push to existing)
Previous PR merged → CREATE NEW (additional changes)
No PR exists → CREATE (first PR)
```

### 5. ASCII Art Banners
Professional boxed banners for all commands:

```
  ╔═══════════════════════════════════════════╗
  ║        🚀  LAUNCHING WORKFLOW  🚀         ║
  ╚═══════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

**Banners for:**
- 🚀 Launch
- 🚢 Ship
- 🧹 Cleanup
- ⛔ Abort
- 🔄 Swap
- 📊 Status
- 📋 Sessions

### 6. Enhanced Ship Command
Complete workflow automation:

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Commits uncommitted changes (runs pre-commit hooks)
2. Pushes to remote (runs pre-push hooks)
3. Creates or updates PR
4. Waits for CI checks to pass
5. Auto-merges with squash
6. Syncs local main branch
7. Deletes feature branches (local + remote)
8. Marks session as complete

**Pre-Flight Checks:**
- Session valid
- Not on main branch
- GitHub configured
- No branch reuse
- No PR conflicts
- Git hooks configured

**Post-Flight Verifications:**
- PR merged
- Branches deleted
- Main synced
- Session complete
- On main branch
- No uncommitted changes
- Single PR lifecycle maintained

### 7. Enhanced Launch Command
Comprehensive validation before launch:

**Pre-Flight Checks:**
- On main/master branch
- Working directory clean
- Main up to date with origin
- No existing session
- Branch name available

**Post-Flight Verifications:**
- Session created
- Feature branch created
- Branch checked out
- Session state correct
- No uncommitted changes

### 8. Enhanced Cleanup Command
Defensive cleanup with verification:

**Pre-Flight Checks:**
- Git repository valid
- DevSolo initialized

**Workflow:**
- Syncs main branch with remote
- Finds orphaned branches/sessions
- Prompts for confirmation
- Removes sessions/branches
- Switches to main if needed

**Post-Flight Verifications:**
- On main branch
- Orphaned branches removed
- No stale sessions
- Working directory clean

### 9. Enhanced Abort/Swap/Status/Sessions
All commands updated with consistent pattern:
- Pre-flight validation
- ASCII art banner
- Workflow execution
- Post-flight verification (where applicable)
- Clear reporting

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

v2 is built on these principles:

1. **Defensive by Default** - Validate before executing
2. **Transparent** - Show all checks to user
3. **Fail Fast** - Catch issues early
4. **Atomic** - Complete or fail completely
5. **Verifiable** - Confirm expected state
6. **Recoverable** - Provide clear solutions
7. **Consistent** - Same pattern everywhere
8. **Professional** - Clean visual output

---

## 📈 Performance

- **Reduced Commands:** 4 → 1 for shipping
- **Fewer Errors:** Pre-flight checks catch issues early
- **Better UX:** Consistent visual output
- **Safer Operations:** Post-flight verification
- **Cleaner Repos:** Automatic cleanup
