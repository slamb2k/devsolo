# Adapter Layer Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented an adapter layer to integrate v2 commands with the existing CLI and MCP server infrastructure. This fixes the critical workflow bug where PR merges didn't trigger automatic cleanup.

## Problem Statement

The v1 `devsolo ship` command had a critical bug:
- PR merges through GitHub UI/auto-merge didn't trigger cleanup
- Users were left on feature branches with orphaned remote branches
- Manual cleanup was required after every external PR merge

## Solution: Adapter Layer

Created adapters that wrap v2 commands while maintaining v1 API compatibility.

### Files Created

#### Adapter Directory (`src/commands/adapters/`)

1. **ship-adapter.ts** - Wraps ShipCommandV2
   - Maps v1 multi-step flags (`--push`, `--create-pr`, `--merge`) to v2's automatic workflow
   - Provides legacy methods: `push()`, `createPR()`, `merge()`
   - **Key Fix**: All methods delegate to v2's `execute()` which runs complete workflow including cleanup

2. **launch-adapter.ts** - Wraps LaunchCommandV2
   - Adds `resume()` method missing from v2
   - Maintains v1 method signature compatibility

3. **abort-adapter.ts** - Wraps AbortCommandV2
   - Adds `abortAll()` method missing from v2
   - Provides bulk abort functionality

4. **swap-adapter.ts** - Wraps SwapCommandV2
   - Handles v1's overloaded signature: `execute(branchName?, options?)`
   - Maps to v2's signature: `execute(options)`

5. **status-adapter.ts** - Wraps StatusCommandV2
   - Implements `CommandHandler` interface required by CLI
   - Provides `validate()` method

6. **sessions-adapter.ts** - Wraps SessionsCommandV2
   - Provides helper methods: `getActiveCount()`, `getCurrentSession()`, `listBranchesWithSessions()`

7. **cleanup-adapter.ts** - Wraps DevSoloCleanupCommandV2
   - Implements `CommandHandler` interface
   - Maps args to options for v2 command

8. **index.ts** - Exports all adapters

### Files Modified

1. **src/cli.ts**
   - Changed imports from v1 commands to adapter commands
   - Now uses: `import { LaunchCommand, ShipCommand, ... } from './commands/adapters'`

2. **src/mcp/devsolo-mcp-server.ts**
   - Changed imports from v1 commands to adapter commands
   - MCP server now uses v2 implementation through adapters

3. **src/commands/command-adapters.ts** (renamed from adapters.ts)
   - Updated to import from `./adapters/` directory
   - Renamed to avoid conflict with adapters directory

4. **src/commands/command-registry.ts**
   - Updated import path to `./command-adapters`
   - Added CleanupCommand and DevSoloStatusCommand adapters

## How It Works

### Before (V1)
```typescript
// User runs: devsolo ship --create-pr
// Result: PR created, but if merged externally, cleanup never runs

ship() {
  if (options.createPR) {
    createPR();  // Creates PR
    // ❌ Cleanup only runs if --merge flag also used
  }
}
```

### After (V2 via Adapter)
```typescript
// User runs: devsolo ship
// Result: Complete workflow runs automatically

execute(options) {
  // V2 does everything in one command
  return this.v2Command.execute({
    message: options.message,
    yes: options.yes,
    force: options.force,
  });
}

// V2 workflow:
async executeCompleteWorkflow() {
  await commitChanges();
  await pushToRemote();
  await createOrUpdatePR();
  await waitAndMerge();
  await syncMainAndCleanup();  // ✅ ALWAYS RUNS
}
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Automatic Cleanup**: v2's ship workflow always runs cleanup after PR merge
2. **No Breaking Changes**: Adapters maintain v1 API, so existing scripts/workflows continue working
3. **Single Command**: Users run `devsolo ship` once instead of multiple invocations with flags
4. **External Merge Detection**: v2 waits for PR to merge (even if merged externally) then runs cleanup
5. **Better State Tracking**: Session state properly transitions to COMPLETE after cleanup

## Build Verification

✅ TypeScript compilation successful with no errors
✅ All adapters properly export classes
✅ CLI and MCP server successfully updated to use adapters
✅ Command registry properly registers v2 commands through adapters

## Testing Recommendations

### End-to-End Ship Workflow Test

```bash
# Start fresh feature
devsolo launch "test-adapter-integration"

# Make changes
echo "test" > test.txt
git add test.txt

# Ship (should do everything automatically)
devsolo ship

# Expected result:
# ✅ Changes committed
# ✅ Pushed to remote
# ✅ PR created
# ✅ CI checks pass
# ✅ PR merged (squash)
# ✅ Switched to main
# ✅ Main synced with origin
# ✅ Feature branch deleted (local + remote)
# ✅ Session marked COMPLETE
# ✅ Currently on main branch
```

### Verify Cleanup After External Merge

```bash
# Start feature
devsolo launch "test-external-merge"
echo "test" > test.txt
git add test.txt

# Commit and push only
git commit -m "test"
git push -u origin test-external-merge

# Create PR manually via GitHub UI
gh pr create --title "Test" --body "Test"

# Get PR number
PR_NUM=$(gh pr list --json number --jq '.[0].number')

# Merge PR externally
gh pr merge $PR_NUM --squash --auto

# Now run ship - should detect merge and run cleanup
devsolo ship

# Expected result:
# ✅ Detects PR already merged
# ✅ Switches to main
# ✅ Syncs main
# ✅ Deletes feature branches
# ✅ Session marked COMPLETE
```

## Migration Path for Users

### No Action Required

- Existing workflows continue working
- `devsolo ship --push`, `devsolo ship --create-pr`, etc. still work
- All commands now delegate to v2's robust implementation

### Recommended Update

Users should simplify their workflows:

**Before:**
```bash
devsolo ship
devsolo ship --push
devsolo ship --create-pr
# Manual merge on GitHub
# Manual cleanup required
```

**After:**
```bash
devsolo ship
# Done! Everything automatic including cleanup
```

## Technical Details

### API Compatibility Matrix

| Command | V1 Method | V2 Equivalent | Adapter Provides |
|---------|-----------|---------------|------------------|
| launch | `resume()` | N/A | ✅ Implements in adapter |
| abort | `abortAll()` | N/A | ✅ Implements in adapter |
| swap | `execute(branch, opts)` | `execute(opts)` | ✅ Handles both signatures |
| ship | Multiple flags | Single workflow | ✅ Maps all flags to v2 |
| status | N/A | N/A | ✅ Adds CommandHandler |
| cleanup | N/A | N/A | ✅ Adds CommandHandler |

### Pre-flight and Post-flight Checks

V2 commands include comprehensive validation:

**Pre-flight Checks (Before execution):**
- Session valid
- Not on main branch
- GitHub configured
- Branch not reused after merge
- No PR conflicts
- Hooks configured

**Post-flight Checks (After execution):**
- PR merged
- Feature branches deleted (local + remote)
- Main branch synced
- Session marked COMPLETE
- Currently on main
- No uncommitted changes
- Single PR lifecycle maintained
