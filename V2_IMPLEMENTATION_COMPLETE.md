# Han-Solo V2 Implementation Complete 🎉

## Overview

All han-solo commands have been updated with a consistent implementation pattern:

```
Pre-flight checks → ASCII art banner → Execute workflow → Post-flight verifications → Report results
```

## ✅ Completed Work

### Core Infrastructure (Phases 1-6)
1. **Pre/Post-Flight Check Framework** (`src/services/validation/pre-flight-checks.ts`)
   - Abstract base classes with extensible check system
   - Visual output (✓/⚠/✗) with pass/fail tracking
   - Automatic suggestion generation for failures
   - Summary display with error/warning counts

2. **Branch Validation** (`src/services/validation/branch-validator.ts`)
   - Branch reuse prevention after merge
   - Detects: merged-and-deleted, merged-and-recreated, continued-work scenarios
   - Tracks branch deletion in session metadata
   - Generates alternative branch name suggestions

3. **PR Validation** (`src/services/validation/pr-validator.ts`)
   - Ensures single PR per feature branch lifecycle
   - Detects: multiple open PRs (blocks), existing PR (updates), previous merged PR (creates new)
   - Defensive checks with clear action recommendations

4. **ASCII Art Banners** (`src/ui/ascii-art.ts`)
   - Consistent visual branding across all commands
   - Professional boxed banners for each workflow step

### Updated Commands (Phase 7)

#### 1. Launch Command V2 (`hansolo-launch-v2.ts`)
**Pre-Flight Checks:**
- On main/master branch
- Working directory clean
- Main up to date with origin
- No existing session
- Branch name available (prevents reuse after merge)

**Workflow:**
- Creates session
- Creates feature branch
- Sets up environment

**Post-Flight Verifications:**
- Session created
- Feature branch created and checked out
- Correct session state (BRANCH_READY)
- No uncommitted changes

#### 2. Ship Command V2 (`hansolo-ship-v2.ts`)
**Pre-Flight Checks:**
- Session valid and active
- Not on main branch
- GitHub integration configured
- No branch reuse detected
- No PR conflicts
- Git hooks configured

**Workflow:**
- Commits changes (runs pre-commit hooks)
- Pushes to remote (runs pre-push hooks)
- Creates or updates PR
- Waits for CI checks
- Auto-merges PR (squash)
- Syncs main and cleanup

**Post-Flight Verifications:**
- PR merged
- Feature branches deleted (local + remote)
- Main branch synced
- Session marked complete
- Currently on main
- No uncommitted changes
- Single PR lifecycle maintained

#### 3. Cleanup Command V2 (`hansolo-cleanup-v2.ts`)
**Pre-Flight Checks:**
- Git repository valid
- Han-solo initialized

**Workflow:**
- Syncs main branch with remote (critical for post-PR cleanup)
- Finds expired/completed sessions
- Finds orphaned branches (no associated session)
- Prompts for confirmation (unless --yes)
- Removes sessions
- Deletes branches
- Switches to main if current branch deleted

**Post-Flight Verifications:**
- On main branch
- Orphaned branches removed
- No stale sessions
- Working directory clean

#### 4. Abort Command V2 (`hansolo-abort-v2.ts`)
**Pre-Flight Checks:**
- Session exists for branch
- Git repository valid

**Workflow:**
- Checks for uncommitted changes (offers to stash)
- Confirms abort action
- Marks session as aborted
- Switches to main
- Optionally deletes branch

**Post-Flight Verifications:**
- Session marked as aborted
- On main branch
- Feature branch deleted (if requested)
- No uncommitted changes

#### 5. Swap Command V2 (`hansolo-swap-v2.ts`)
**Pre-Flight Checks:**
- Target session exists
- Not already on target branch

**Workflow:**
- Handles uncommitted changes (stash or block)
- Switches to target branch

**Post-Flight Verifications:**
- On target branch
- Session active
- Changes stashed (if applicable)

#### 6. Status Command V2 (`hansolo-status-v2.ts`)
**Pre-Flight Checks:**
- Git repository valid
- Han-solo initialized

**Output:**
- Current branch and session info
- Git status (clean, modified, created, deleted)
- Ahead/behind commits
- Verbose session details (optional)

#### 7. Sessions Command V2 (`hansolo-sessions-v2.ts`)
**Pre-Flight Checks:**
- Han-solo initialized

**Output:**
- List of all sessions (active/completed/aborted)
- Session summary (active count, completed count, aborted count)
- Optional cleanup of expired sessions
- Verbose details per session (optional)

```
🔍 Pre-Flight Checks (5/5 passed)
  ✓ On main/master branch: main
  ✓ Working directory clean
  ✓ Main up to date with origin
  ✓ No existing session
  ✓ Branch name available: feature/new-feature

✓ All checks passed (5/5)
```

## 🛡️ Defensive Guarantees

### Enforced Invariants
1. ✅ Only one active session per branch
2. ✅ Only one PR per feature branch lifecycle
3. ✅ No branch reuse after merge + deletion
4. ✅ Main branch always synced after merge
5. ✅ Complete cleanup after successful merge
6. ✅ All checks visible to user
7. ✅ Clear failure messages with suggestions
8. ✅ Orphaned branches cleaned up properly
9. ✅ Always return to main after cleanup/abort

### Branch Reuse Scenarios
| Scenario | Action | Reason |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Merged & Deleted | **BLOCK** | Branch name retired |
| Merged & Recreated | **BLOCK** | Critical - improper reuse |
| Continued Work | **ALLOW** | Adding commits after merge (creates new PR) |
| Aborted | **ALLOW** | Never completed, safe to reuse |

### PR Conflict Scenarios
| Scenario | Action | Reason |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Multiple Open PRs | **BLOCK** | Should never happen - manual intervention needed |
| Single Open PR | **UPDATE** | Push updates to existing PR |
| Previous PR Merged | **CREATE NEW** | Additional changes after merge |
| No PR Exists | **CREATE** | First PR for branch |

## 🔧 Breaking Changes (v2.0.0)

### Removed Flags
- ❌ `--push` from ship command
- ❌ `--create-pr` from ship command
- ❌ `--merge` from ship command

### Migration
**Before (v1):**
```bash
/hansolo:ship            # Commit
/hansolo:ship --push     # Push
/hansolo:ship --create-pr # Create PR
/hansolo:ship --merge    # Merge
```

**After (v2):**
```bash
/hansolo:ship  # Does everything automatically
```

### Kept Flags
- ✅ `--yes` / `-y` (skip confirmations)
- ✅ `--force` / `-f` (override safety checks)
- ✅ `--message` (custom commit message)

## 📋 Next Steps

### Phase 8: Documentation (In Progress)
- [ ] Update README.md with simplified workflow
- [ ] Create PRE-FLIGHT-CHECKS.md documenting all checks
- [ ] Create MIGRATION-V2.md for users upgrading from v1
- [ ] Update command-reference.md with new patterns

### Phase 9: Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for branch-validator
- [ ] Unit tests for pr-validator
- [ ] Unit tests for pre-flight-checks framework
- [ ] Integration tests for v2 commands
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tests

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Replace old commands with v2 versions
- [ ] Update MCP server to remove deprecated flags
- [ ] Add hotfix workflow with pre/post-flight checks
- [ ] Enhanced PR status monitoring with webhooks
- [ ] Configurable check policies per project

## 🎯 Design Philosophy

The v2 implementation enforces these principles:

1. **Defensive by Default** - All operations validated before execution
2. **Transparent** - All checks visible to user with clear output
3. **Fail Fast** - Catch issues in pre-flight before making changes
4. **Atomic** - Complete workflow in single command or fail completely
5. **Verifiable** - Post-flight checks confirm expected state
6. **Recoverable** - Clear suggestions for failures
7. **Consistent** - Same pattern across all commands
8. **Professional** - Clean visual output with ASCII art

## 🚀 Example Session

```bash
# Start new feature
/hansolo:launch "add-user-auth"

# Make changes, commit along the way
git add .
git commit -m "Add auth module"

# Ship everything in one command
/hansolo:ship

# Han-solo automatically:
# ✓ Commits remaining changes
# ✓ Pushes to remote
# ✓ Creates PR
# ✓ Waits for CI checks
# ✓ Merges PR (squash)
# ✓ Syncs main
# ✓ Deletes branches
# ✓ Completes session

# Ready for next feature!
/hansolo:launch "add-password-reset"
```

## 📈 Impact

- **Reduced Commands**: 4 commands → 1 command for shipping
- **Fewer Errors**: Pre-flight checks catch issues early
- **Better UX**: Consistent visual output across all commands
- **Safer Operations**: Post-flight verification confirms success
- **Cleaner Repos**: Automatic cleanup prevents branch/session clutter
- **Linear History**: Enforced single PR per branch lifecycle
