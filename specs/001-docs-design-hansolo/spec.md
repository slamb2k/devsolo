# Feature Specification: han-solo Git Workflow Automation

**Feature Branch**: `001-docs-design-hansolo`
**Created**: 2025-09-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "@docs/design/hansolo-prd.md @docs/design/hansolo-product-brief.md"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer working on a project, I need an automated Git workflow tool that enforces best practices, prevents merge conflicts, and maintains linear history while reducing the time I spend on repetitive Git operations. The tool should work for both solo developers and teams, adapting to organizational constraints while maintaining developer control over critical decisions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new project without Git initialization, **When** developer runs initialization command, **Then** system creates Git repository, sets up remote repository if needed, configures hooks, and marks project as ready for han-solo workflows
2. **Given** an initialized project, **When** developer starts a new feature workflow, **Then** system creates a feature branch from updated main, tracks session state, and provides visual feedback of workflow progress
3. **Given** changes ready to ship, **When** developer runs ship command, **Then** system validates changes, generates commit messages, creates pull request, and guides through merge process while maintaining linear history
4. **Given** a critical production issue, **When** developer initiates hotfix workflow, **Then** system creates hotfix branch, applies fix, and backports to appropriate branches with automatic validation
5. **Given** multiple active workflows, **When** developer switches between sessions, **Then** system preserves state of each session and allows seamless context switching
6. **Given** a workflow in progress, **When** AI assistance is unavailable, **Then** system continues with deterministic workflow completion using manual fallbacks

### Edge Cases
- What happens when merge conflicts occur during pre-merge rebasing?
- How does system handle interrupted workflows or terminal crashes?
- What occurs when repository has no remote configured?
- How does system respond when Git hooks are bypassed manually?
- What happens when multiple developers work on same branch?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST enforce linear Git history with no merge commits in main branch
- **FR-002**: System MUST prevent direct commits to main branch through pre-commit hooks
- **FR-003**: System MUST perform pre-merge rebasing to detect conflicts before they affect production
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain session state across terminal sessions and tool invocations
- **FR-005**: Users MUST explicitly approve all commit, push, and pull request operations
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide visual feedback through colors, icons, and progress indicators
- **FR-007**: System MUST support concurrent workflow sessions with unique identifiers
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate intelligent commit messages and PR descriptions when AI is available
- **FR-009**: System MUST provide manual fallback options for all AI-generated content
- **FR-010**: System MUST complete workflows deterministically even without AI assistance
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate all state transitions before execution
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow workflow abortion at any non-irreversible stage
- **FR-013**: System MUST automatically create GitHub/GitLab repositories during initialization if none exist
- **FR-014**: System MUST install to .hansolo/ directory to maintain separation from other tools
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide comprehensive audit trail with timestamps for all operations
- **FR-016**: System MUST support both user-level and project-level component installation
- **FR-017**: System MUST clean up stale sessions after [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: timeout period not specified - 7 days, 30 days?]
- **FR-018**: System MUST squash-merge all pull requests to create atomic commits
- **FR-019**: System MUST provide status visibility through terminal status lines
- **FR-020**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which Git hosting platforms - GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, all?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Workflow Session**: Represents an active workflow with unique ID, associated branch, current state, creation timestamp, and state history
- **Workflow State**: Represents current position in state machine with allowed transitions, validation rules, and rollback capabilities
- **Git Branch**: Represents a feature/hotfix branch with associated session, parent commit, and protection rules
- **Configuration**: Represents user preferences, installation scope, enabled components, and team settings
- **Audit Entry**: Represents a logged operation with timestamp, user, action, result, and context
