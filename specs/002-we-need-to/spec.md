# Feature Specification: NPM Package Publishing and Interactive CLI Installer

**Feature Branch**: `002-we-need-to`
**Created**: 2025-09-23
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We need to publish the tool to npm and add a javascript based installer that can be called when the hansolo is installed either using npm install/npm install -g/npx (no install). The installer should provide a beautiful guided process in the cli that informs the user what is going on, provides the ability for them to choose specific options that suit their dev process and gives clear tips about what to do next."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Each requirement must be testable
   ’ Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ’ If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want to easily install and configure hansolo via npm so that I can quickly integrate it into my development workflow with settings that match my team's processes.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a developer has npm installed, **When** they run `npm install -g @hansolo/cli`, **Then** the package installs and automatically launches an interactive setup wizard
2. **Given** a developer runs `npx @hansolo/cli`, **When** hansolo is not installed locally, **Then** npx downloads and executes hansolo with the interactive installer
3. **Given** the interactive installer is running, **When** the user selects their preferred workflow options, **Then** the tool configures itself according to their selections and saves the configuration
4. **Given** the installer has completed setup, **When** the user views the final screen, **Then** they see clear next steps and commands to start using hansolo
5. **Given** a developer installs hansolo locally in a project, **When** they run `npm install @hansolo/cli`, **Then** the installer runs in project-scoped mode with relevant configuration options

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user cancels the installer mid-process?
- How does system handle when user has insufficient permissions for global install?
- What happens when hansolo is already installed but user runs the installer again?
- How does the installer behave when run in non-interactive environments (CI/CD)?
- What happens when user's terminal doesn't support color or advanced formatting?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST publish hansolo package to npm registry under [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific package name - @hansolo/cli or other?]
- **FR-002**: System MUST automatically trigger interactive installer after npm installation (global, local, or npx execution)
- **FR-003**: Installer MUST display clear visual feedback about current installation progress and status
- **FR-004**: Installer MUST present configuration options relevant to user's development workflow
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to select from [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific workflow options should be configurable?]
- **FR-006**: Installer MUST save user's configuration preferences for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: where should configs be stored - project-level, user-level, or both?]
- **FR-007**: Installer MUST display actionable next steps after successful setup
- **FR-008**: System MUST support installation via npm install (local), npm install -g (global), and npx (no install)
- **FR-009**: Installer MUST provide "beautiful" visual experience with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific UI requirements - colors, animations, ASCII art, progress indicators?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST gracefully handle installation errors and provide helpful error messages
- **FR-011**: Installer MUST be skippable/bypassable for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: automated/CI environments - how to detect and handle?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate installation environment before proceeding with setup
- **FR-013**: Installer MUST inform users about what each step is doing during the process
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle upgrade scenarios when [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how should installer behave when upgrading existing installation?]
- **FR-015**: Installer MUST provide option to reconfigure existing installation

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Configuration Profile**: User's selected workflow preferences and settings that customize hansolo behavior
- **Installation Context**: Environment information including installation type (global/local/npx), existing configurations, and system capabilities
- **Setup Progress State**: Current step in the installation wizard, allowing resume if interrupted
